#Plant Simulations in Blender
generative growth algorithm inspired by plant growth

Currently in development.

## First Iteration Strategy
particles jitter downwards
a box world contains particles; if they go outside they are moved back to the top plane of the box
a directed graph structure grows new nodes each time a node collides with a particle
